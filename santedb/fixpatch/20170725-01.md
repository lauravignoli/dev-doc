# Update 2017-07-25

**Summary:** This update changes high transaction volume tables to use INT instead of UUID
**Category:** Performance Enhancement
**Details:** In the original data schema entity addresses, names, and related sets all use 128-bit UUIDs. However, these UUIDs are never exposed to the outside world, they are only used internally which represents a performance hit when searching by these columns. This patch increases the performance of the SanteDB database by switching these to INT.
**Bug / Issues:** N/A  
**Applies To:** OpenIZ Server, SanteDB Server  
**Impacted Versions:**  0.9.0.1   
**Status:** Released \(July 25, 2017\)  
**Impact:** Moderate
**RDBMS:** PostgreSQL
