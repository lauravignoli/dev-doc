# Update 2017-10-11

**Summary:** Adds trigger constraints
**Category:** Bugfix
**Details:** With this update, SanteDB now enforces the types of relationships between entities. Prior to this trigger, it was possible to relate entities in ways which made no sense (for example, a Place could be a Parent of a Patient). This update creates a validation trigger which is used to verify that the relationship being inserted into the database makes sense from a semantic standpoint.

**Applies To:** OpenIZ Server, SanteDB Server  
**Impacted Versions:**  0.9.0.5 
**Status:** Released \(October 11, 2017\)
