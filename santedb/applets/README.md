# Applets

Applets are the foundation of extending SanteDB. An applet can contain:

* Custom user interface components \(using CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, and HTML5\)
* Custom Business Rules written using the SanteDB Business Rules engine
* Custom Reports written using the embedded reporting engine \(those which operate in all SanteDB environments\)
* Clinical Decision Support Rules \(CDSS\) written using XML formatted when/then commands
* Custom View-Model files which instruct SanteDB how to render JSON to consumer applications
* Translations and localization settings for a particular locale
* Custom matching configurations used for the SanteDB Matching Algorithms
* Clinical Template Definitions which contain the validation rules, entry and render forms, and structure of clinical data
