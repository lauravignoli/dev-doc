# Service APIs

SanteDB Server and the Disconnected Client expose a series of APIs which can be used to interact with the services. 

Swagger / OpenAPI 2.0 documentation for the SanteDB Server is available at: [https://santedb.santesuite.net:8443/api-docs/index.html](https://santedb.santesuite.net:8443/api-docs/index.html)

{% hint style="info" %}
These services will be moved to Fyfe Software's server in February 2020 and will no longer be available. This page will be updated when that migration occurs.
{% endhint %}
