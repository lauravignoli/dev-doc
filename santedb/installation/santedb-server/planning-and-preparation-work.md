# Planning & Preparation Work

## Before You Deploy

Before you can deploy SanteDB, you first must consider the environment into which the server will be deployed. SanteDB is configured and secured in different manners depending on a variety of factors. A few questions you should consider before installing SanteDB:

### **Purpose of Deployment**

Identify the purposes for which the deployment will be used. SanteDB is configured in different ways depending on the intended use of the software. For example, SanteDB deployed to support SanteGuard is much different than SanteDB deployed for development purposes.

### Server Environment

Once you have established the purpose of your deployment, identify the server environment which will run SanteDB, this decision might be made based on your current budget, current support contracts, and current capacity of resources.
