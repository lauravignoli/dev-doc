# About SanteMPI

SanteMPI is a brand new, fully Open Source Master Patient Index \(MPI\) solution. In reality, SanteMPI simply bundles together existing functions of SanteDB \(MDM, Matching, Entity Linking, etc.\) and exposes additional logic on top of those interfaces to ensure it is a PIX/PDQ compliant product. 

SanteMPI works in both the SanteDB iCDR and the dCDR, that's right, you can run a mini-MPI offline in a local clinic between systems.

SanteMPI is still undergoing heavy development on the user interface, so the screenshots in this section may not be up to date with the latest revision.
