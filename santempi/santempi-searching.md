# SanteMPI Searching

SanteMPI exposes several resources for searching patient information. 

## Basic Search

Basic searching will perform a name search, or if your SanteDB instance supports it, a FreeText search of indexed fields \(identifiers or name, or address, etc.\).

## Power Search

The SanteMPI PowerSearch interface allows you to more finely tune your search results. For example, if you wanted to search for all patients with a last name JOHNSTON who are MALE you would use the PowerSearch function.
